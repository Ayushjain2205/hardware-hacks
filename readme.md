# Tag-Yo

Tag-Yo is an automation platform that enables users to create custom automations with NFC tags.

## Inspiration

I was inspired by the potential of NFC technology to simplify and streamline daily tasks. With the increasing popularity of NFC-enabled devices, I saw an opportunity to create a powerful automation tool that leverages the convenience of tapping NFC tags to trigger custom actions.

## What it does

Tag-Yo allows users to define their own triggers, such as tap, double tap, or triple tap, and associate them with personalized actions. Users have full control over the automations they create, empowering them to tailor the system to their specific needs and preferences. The range of available actions includes fetching data, sending to phone, sending to WhatsApp, sending to mail, and more.

## How it's built

Tag-Yo is built using modern web technologies, including React for the front-end, Node.js for the back-end, and MongoDB Atlas for the database. Twilio, a popular messaging service, is integrated for notifications and messaging functionality. This combination of cutting-edge technologies allows for a robust and efficient automation platform with a seamless user experience.

## Challenges and accomplishments

During the development of Tag-Yo, I faced challenges such as designing a user-friendly interface, integrating with external APIs, ensuring data security and privacy, and optimizing performance. Despite these challenges, I am proud of creating a user-friendly interface, seamlessly integrating external APIs, and ensuring the security of user data.

## What I learned

The development of Tag-Yo provided valuable learning experiences in working with NFC technology, integrating external APIs, optimizing performance, and creating a user-centric design. I also enhanced my skills in modern web technologies, such as React, Node.js, and MongoDB Atlas.

## What's next

The journey of Tag-Yo doesn't end here. Plans for the future include refining the user interface, adding more triggers and actions, and exploring potential partnerships and integrations with other platforms and services to provide even more value to our users. Stay tuned for exciting updates from Tag-Yo!
